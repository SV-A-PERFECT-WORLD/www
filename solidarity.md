# Solidarity 

... means we choose to create something greater together, than any of us could create alone. 

While I could sail solo, a crew multiplies our capabilities. Your attentiveness during watch enables my rest, my care in the galley nourishes us all, each person's contribution amplifies what we can achieve and experience together.

We practice solidarity through mutual respect, shared labor, social pricing and the daily choice to create synergy rather than merely coexist. 

And solidarity extends beyond our boat. It connects us to the communities we visit, to sailors we encounter, and to those in distress who need assistance. We travel not as tourists passing through, but as participants in a global community. 

Our commitment to living within our global fair share of resources, and our readiness to help others at sea, are expressions of solidarity beyond our crew.

It's this spirit of connection -- both aboard and with the wider world -- that makes our journey not just possible, but meaningful.

[Sustainability](./sustainable) (global level) is a direct consequence of solidarity. Staying within our fair share of resources is solidarity with the current population. Preserving resources for future generations is solidarity with those to come.
