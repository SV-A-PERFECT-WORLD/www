- secure galley and cabins

- switch on instruments

- unlock rudder, tension steering lines, test hard-over

- prepare foresail, midsail[^2mast] and aftsail [^aft_like_mainsail]

- lower, activate and test engines


## Lifting Anchor

- take in first meters until hook

- remove bridal hook

- lift remaining anchor until almost vertical

- break anchor and watch drift

- store anchor

## Begin Sailing

- engage engine power (a bit)

- turn into desired course

- deploy foresail

- check speed and course

- stop engine


## Sailing Upwind

- test highest wind angle

- pick a reliable heading, pointing high

- engage autohelm within limits of boatspeed, windspeed and rudder force

- adjust heading to small changes in wind direction (manually or with autohelm)


## Stopping the Boat [^2mast] [^catamaran]

- head into the wind

- roll-reef the foresail

- center aftsail [^aft_like_mainsail]

- drop or center midsail [^2mast]

- lock rudder in central position at the wheel or tiller


## Tacking

- travel aftsail far windward (helps turning) [^aft_like_mainsail]

- put midsail on central ("main") sheet (remove traveller sheet) [^2mast]

- prepare windward foresheet (check that not stuck)

- ease foresail, initiate turn windwards

- tighten midsheet and aftsheet as boat turns through wind

- change foresail to new leeside at wind angle ~ 30°

- find new heading, likely old heading +- 100° (course +- 120°)

- trim sails again


## Anchoring

- pick anchor location

- approach anchor location under sail

- turn into wind

- roll-reef foresail

- engage engine power (a bit)

- drop anchor 

- observe drift and swinging

- pay out more anchor chaino

- hook bridal into chain

- observe final situation


## Sorting the boat

- clean foresheet and roll-reef line

- lift engines

- switch off instruments

- lock rudder

- pack midsail with spider cord, wrap midsail peak halyard around mast [^2mast]

- pack aftsail with 3 helper strings, keep halyards from mast with bungee cord


[^2mast]: specific to a two-mast rig

[^aft_like_mainsail] here a one-master's mailsail is equivalent to the Tiki's aftsail

[^catamaran]: specific to a catamaran
