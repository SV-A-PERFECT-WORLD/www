[![A PERFECT WORLD](./i/title_2560.jpg)](/)

Here you find a logical drilldown from values to goals to principles down to rules.

> This is still a draft. The list is quite complete and I will add missing explanations for each item.

<details markdown=1 id="explain"><summary class="soft">Please let me explain.</summary>

All these value, goals, principles and rules are connected. Every rule has a history or an obvious reason. Every rule supports a principle. Every principle helps to achieve a goal. Every goal supports a value.

This is an attempt of Rule Utilitarianism: to maximize our collective wellbeing and to make sustainable living possible[^1]. The rules may seem strict at first glance, but they're designed to create the predictability, fairness, and resource efficiency that allow us all to thrive together in a challenging environment. 

I recognize that living by explicit rules can feel rigid or unempathetic — but on a boat with limited resources, shared rules actually create more freedom and less conflict than everyone making individual calculations. That said, I encourage critical thinking and actively welcome suggestions for improvement, because the goal isn't rigidity but finding the best guidelines for our shared flourishing.
</details>

Where is the fun? Not *in* the rules. The fun is in our individual creativity, be it shared or private, within the limits of our constraints. Accidents at sea are not fun. Scarcity or dependencies are not fun. That's why we try to offload these stress factors, for more fun and happiness on board.

{% include values.md %}

{% include goals.md %}

# Principles

*how* we achieve goals - abstract rules

1. we admire the wonders of nature <l abel="sustainable (g)" />

   Admiration and deepest respect for nature is the ultimate reason for our sustainable life.

   If you want a reason for it. You can also live in sustainable ways, intuitively.

1. we respect the mercilessness of nature <l abel="Freedom" /> <l abel="safe"/>

   We are fully aware of nature's supreme power.

   Taking informed risks enables our freedom of movement.

   Moving respectfully keeps us safe.

1. we respect each other <l abel="Solidarity" />

1. we create synergy by helping each other <l abel="Solidarity" /><l abel="efficient" />

1. we improve our skills <l abel="Growth" /><l abel="Solidarity" />

   ... so that we can perform our roles together, safely and happily.

   Learning and improving skills means personal growth for each crew member.

   Performing a greater set of roles supports the rest of the crew.

1. we respect the boat 

1. we repair the boat <l abel="sustainable (i)" />

   There is always something to repair or to improve on the boat.

   Every member of the crew contributes some working time into these tasks, while we are not sailing.

1. we clean the boat

   -- like above --

1. we travel by wind, not by engine <l abel="sustainable (g)" /><l abel="travel" />

   The small electric engines are good for anchor- and harbour manoeuvres, and not sufficient for serious travel (not for opposing strong wind or current).

   This is the trade-off for Zero Emissions. Actually larger engines and batteries are quite feasible, but these are not exactly sustainable either.

1. we cannot make reliable schedules for passages

   see before: our passages totally depend on wind, which is not predictable

1. we anchor by default <l abel="Autonomy" />

   We rarely use marinas and anchor instead ... just because we can :-)

   Also it saves operating costs.

1. we split costs for marinas <l abel="Solidarity" />

   Should we choose to use a harbour for convenience or as shelter in hard weather, we split the costs. 

   The crew chooses a harbour consensually. 

   The skipper chooses a harbour for safety purposes.

1. we split costs for food on board <l abel="Solidarity" /> <l abel="Autonomy">

   The boat carries food stocks for many weeks, which we rotate (consume in sequence of "best-before-date") and re-supply.

   We estimate the price of consumed food, e.g. **10 € / person / day**.

1. we split costs for operating the boat <l abel="Solidarity" /><l abel="travel" />

   The standard share of operating costs is:

       10    € / person / day
        +
        0.10 € / person /  NM
   
   ... travelled towards an agreed destination (e.g. 600 NM from Gibraltar to Fuerteventura = 60 €, no matter how much tacking)

   Social pricing applies.

1. we seek efficient and safe procedures 

   We constantly improve our ways of doing things, so that they are safer or faster or more fun than yesterday.

1. we don't create traps <l abel="safe" />  

   examples: open hatches (in particular the "well"), small or large things in pathways which could be kicked accidentally or cause a person to trip; things that could fall into the water

1. we sort everything back into its place after use <l abel="safe" /> <l abel="efficient" />

1. we make best use of available space

1. we use water responsibly <l abel="sustainable (+)" />

   We save water in our tanks and, at the same time, for the planet.

1. we use energy responsibly <l abel="Autonomy" />

   Electric energy on board is limited by the capacity of our batteries and the daily harvest.

   2 hours of baking crepes consumes the equivalent of 50 NM travelled by engine. When batteries are full, we can cook like nobody's watching.

1. we source and consume food responsibly <l abel="sustainable (+)" />

1. we *stock* food that is vegan + organic <l abel="sustainable (g)" /> <l abel="healthy" />

   ... and we can have fresh food of any diet for current crew on board.

   Part of that logic is that we rotate stocks. You eat what we bought months earlier. So the food stocks shall serve anybody.

   Plus, unrefrigerated vegan food keeps better and causes less food poisoning than animal-based food.

1. we follow rules until we improve them <l abel="efficient"/> <l abel="safe"/> <l abel="Growth"/>

   We hold review meetings regularly, and we try to identify friction and tension. *"What was good? What needs to be improved?"* are the typical questions to ask. Then we implement changes.

   Until that time: just follow the established rules.

1. we apply *social pricing* <l abel="Solidarity"/> <l abel="sustainable (i)" />

   In short: richer people can pay a larger contribution towards the operating cost.
 
   People with less income or savings can benefit from reduced shares in operating costs.

   In theory, social pricing could also fund the food for some crew members. However, I do not like the idea of a crew member who depends 100% on the boat and its social system, for all of their vital needs. They might be motivated or forced to stay with the boat, even if they disagree or otherwise do not enjoy their stay. I want adult crew members with a realistic exit strategy.


# House Rules

specific rules and instructions

1. be sceptical and critical about every rule, and follow rules until we negotiate better rules <l abel="safe"/> <l abel="Solidarity"/>

1. speak your mind, challenge any rule and make a better suggestion <l abel="Growth"/>

1. ask questions <l abel="safe"/> <l abel="Growth"/>

   Ask questions any time, and absolutely if you need more information to perform a duty.

   In particular, always contact the skipper if something unusual happens during your watch.

1. crew must be able to set sails, lift anchor and climb on board <l abel="safe"/>

1. no alcohol during passage <l abel="safe"/>

   No alcohol during passage or other duties (e.g. anchor watch). Also not in "off shifts": there is not enough time to fully recover before your next shift.

   Same applies to other drugs.

1. be ready to wear lifevest, gloves and helmet <l abel="safe"/>

1. clip in or move in safe places <l abel="safe"/>

   The skipper will show you safe places and clip-in points on deck.

1. come on time for all appointments <l abel="Respect"/>

   Most notably for shifts, when the previous watchkeeper and stand-by people and the skipper are counting on a hand-over or briefing with you - and in general, for the respect for each other 


1. bring all personal stuff for your shift to the bridge <l abel="efficient"/> <l abel="safe"/>

   Bring all your personal stuff (life vest, clothes, drinks, snacks...) for your shift to the bridge, where you have it accessible. No visit to your cabin should be necessary during your shift.
   Having protective gear available at an arm's length is a matter of safety.
   Avoiding unnecessary trips to the cabin, or asking the stand-by person for assistance, is a matter of efficiency. Of course you must not hesitate to ask for help in any unforseen situation.

1. start a shift with all your biological needs already served <l abel="efficient"/> <l abel="Solidarity"/>

   No breaks for toilet or meals in the galley shall be necessary during a typical 3-hour shift.
   However, snacking in the helm is OK.


1. don't step on ropes

1. coil ropes when not in use

1. cook recipies that preserve resources (water, energy)

1. cook for each other

1. rotate food stocks (use oldest first)

1. buy only as much as we can consume 

1. open only one container max per food type

1. <p class="soft">buy dry / dehydrated food instead of liquid</p>

   This saves weight and space and packaging, and allows us to store more calories at the same weight.

1. keep and eat food only in the galley or eat on deck

1. no private food stashes

1. no eating in cabins

1. clean dishes immediately

1. clean dishes with help of silicone spoon and hot water

1. ventilate cabins sufficiently 

   Depending on the climate, there will be condensation in the cabins. Ventilate accordingly.

1. wipe cabin walls clean from condensation

   See above -- remove all condensating humidity.

1. store mattress vertically

   Keep mattresses vertically during the day, so that they can ventilate.

1. wipe cabin floor clean from water 

   This serves boat maintenance, safety and so that we can monitor water intake from waves, rain or leaks.

1. use outdoor toilet at sea, or use WC at land

1. en-suite toilet only for absolute emergencies

1. <p class="soft">exercise every day...         <l abel="healthy"/> <p> 

   ... in some way. This is not about olympic excellence.

   I suggest that you remain in contact with your body, keep it fit for your role as a sailor, and stay healthy. Hoisting sails, lifting anchor and climbing on board shall not only be possible but be well within your comfort zone.

   Active sailing counts as exercise. Swimming and cold exposure counts as exercise. Primal movement and contact improvisation count as exercise, for examples.

1. <p class="soft">medidate, if you have time... <l abel="healthy"/> </p> 

   ... and meditate even more if you don't have time :-)
