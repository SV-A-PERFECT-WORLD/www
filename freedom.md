# free

A simple word. Where shall we begin? Let's try this:

> **All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.**[^1]

I agree. One particular type of freedom that I enjoy is the freedom of movement[^2].

The UDHR states some active forms of freedom: to *do* something (move, think, speak, choose...), and passive (or negative) forms, such as the freedom *from* something (i.e., freedom from oppression, from fear, from want...).

On this website I am using the term freedom in both forms. Safety, for example, supports freedom in the sense that it keeps us free from injury and harm.

Passive forms of freedom enable us to pursue the active forms of freedom which we value.

Also, I keep thinking about this one:

> **The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.**[^camus]

When I travel on the off-grid boat, free to choose when and where I make contact with civilization, I get the impression that some people perceive me as a rebel. Often these are people who are stuck in their routines, and my very existence challenges their worldview.

---

Autonomy, based on the boat as a self-sufficient off-grid unit, remains a central goal for me.

It allows us to travel -- exercise our right to freedom of movement. Thanks to autonomy, we can stay at sea or at anchor for weeks or even months. We have the freedom to choose the destinations that we visit.

---

In the triad of our core values (Solidarity, Sustainability & Freedom) I am tempted to rank Freedom higher. But it must be ranked after Sustainability, because personal freedom must not come at the price of taking more than a fair share of resources.
