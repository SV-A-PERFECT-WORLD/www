# Freedom

A simple word. Where shall we begin? Let's try this:

> **All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.** [^1]

I agree. One particular type of freedom that I enjoy is the freedom of movement[^2]. The other human rights and types of freedom aren't bad, either.

The UDHR states some *active* (or *positive*) forms of freedom: to *do* something ([move](./universal-declaration-of-human-rights/#article-13), [marry](./universal-declaration-of-human-rights/#article-16), [think, believe](./universal-declaration-of-human-rights/#article-18), [speak](./universal-declaration-of-human-rights/#article-19) ...), and *passive* (or *negative*) forms, such as the freedom *from* something (i.e., freedom from oppression, from fear, from want...).

On this website I am using the term freedom in both forms. <l abel="Safety"/>, for example, supports freedom in the sense that it keeps us free from injury and harm.

Passive forms of freedom enable us to pursue the active forms of freedom which we value.

Also, I keep thinking about this one:

> **The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.** [^camus]

When I travel on the off-grid boat, free to choose when and where I make contact with civilization, I get the impression that some people perceive me as a rebel. Often these are people who are stuck in their routines, and my very existence challenges their worldview.

---

Autonomy, based on the boat as a self-sufficient off-grid unit, remains a central goal for me.

It allows us to <l abel="travel"/> -- exercise our right to freedom of movement. Thanks to <l abel="autonomy"/>, we can stay at sea or at anchor for weeks or even months. We have the freedom to choose the destinations that we visit.

---

My personal freedom cannot come at the price of harming others. Therefore, <a href="sustainable"><l abel="Sustainability"/></a> comes first and all travel and automony must be sustainable by global standards.

---

Finally, freedom exists not only me, or for "us" on the boat. *All human beings are born free.* This is just one way of explaining why the crew on <span class="fredericka">A PERFECT WORLD</span> is commited to helping everybody with enjoying their right to freedom in <l abel="Solidarity"/>.
