# Freedom

A simple word. Where shall we begin? Let's try this:

> **All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.**[^1]

I agree. And another form of freedom that I particularly value is the freedom of movement.

The UDHR states some active forms of freedom: to *do* something (move, think, speak, choose...), and passive (or negative) forms, such as the freedom *from* something (i.e., freedom from oppression, fear, want...).

One this webiste I am using the term freedom in both forms. Safety, for example, supports freedom in the sense that it keeps us free from injury and harm.

Passive forms of freedom enable us to pursue the active forms of freedom which we value.

Also I keep thinking about this one:

> **The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.**[^2]

When I travel on the off-grid boat, free to choose when and where I make contact with civilization, I get the impression that some people perceive me a rebel. Often these are people who are stuck in their routines, and my very existence challenges their worldview.
