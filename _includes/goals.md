# Goals

*what* we want to achieve or maintain - these are specific and measurable

1. **Growth**: we constantly learn and grow, personally and together
1. Stay in Good **Health**
1. **Zero Emissions**: be it carbon, toxic or otherwise harmful for the environment
1. **Zero Waste**: no wasted food, minimal trash, responsible use of each and any resource
1. **Autonomy**: the boat as a self-sufficient offgrid unit
1. **Travel**: changing location from time to time - not necessarily permanently
1. Go on **Missions**: render humanitarian assistance, as the location and weather allow it
