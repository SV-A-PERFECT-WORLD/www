# Goals

*what* we want to achieve or maintain - these are specific and measurable

1. Growth <l abel="sustainable (i)"/> <l abel="Solidarity"/>

   we constantly learn and grow, personally and together, for a well functioning and satisfying, long lasting life on board

1. Zero Emissions <l abel="sustainable (g)"/>

   be it carbon, toxic or otherwise harmful for the environment

1. Zero Waste <l abel="sustainable (+)"/>

   no wasted food, minimal trash, responsible use of each and every resource

   This is sustainable globally because we stay within our global fair share, and sustainable for the boat because we maximize autonomy via minimal resource consumption.
   
1. Stay in Good Health <l abel="sustainable (i)"/> <l abel="free"/>

   I can continue to achieve my goals, and exercise my freedom, only in good health

1. Autonomy <l abel="free"/>

   the boat as a self-sufficient offgrid unit

1. Travel <l abel="free"/>

   changing location from time to time - not necessarily permanently

1. Go on Missions<l abel="Solidarity"/>

   render humanitarian assistance
