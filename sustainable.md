# Sustainable

Sustainability is the ability to continue something for a long time[^1].

There are two levels of interpretation:

1. the individual level: "I could do this all my life"
1. the global level: "We, humankind, could do this forever"

Sustainability on the personal level is limited by my time, my energy, my financial budget and perhaps by opportunities.

Sustainability on the global level is limited by globally limited resources such as space, water and food, as well as by accumulated impact on the environment. Divide every globally limited resource by the world population of humans, and you get the *fair share* of that resource. We, as humankind, can only continue forever, if every human keeps their consumption within the fair share of every relevant resource.

Take carbon emissions as an example. The Paris Agreement[^2] aims to limit global warming to 2°C, which requires humanity to stay within a "carbon budget" of roughly 400 billion tonnes of CO₂ per year, worldwide. Divided equally among the world's 8 billion people, this translates to a fair share of approximately 2-3 tonnes CO₂ emissions per person per year. The current global average emissions are about 4.7 tonnes per person annually, with huge disparities between 1 - 15 tonnes in different parts of the world.

Life on board of A PERFECT WORLD achieves the Carbon Footprint sustainability goal already today, with estimated 3 tonnes CO₂ emissions per year (solo) or 2.2 tonnes per person per year, in a crew of 4 people[^3].
